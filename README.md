## 🤖 AI Implementation
The **CPU opponent** uses a **Greedy Algorithm**, which means it:
- Always picks the **move that flips the most pieces** immediately.
- Does **not** predict future moves (not as strong as Minimax AI).

Future improvements may include:
- **Minimax Algorithm** for a smarter AI.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning** to optimize AI performance.

🚀 Improve AI difficulty (Minimax / Alpha-Beta Pruning).  
🎨 Enhance UI with better graphics, sound, and animations.  
🌍 Add **Online Multiplayer** support using Firebase.  
📊 Show **score indicators** on the board.
